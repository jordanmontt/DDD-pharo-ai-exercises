K-Means is a clustering, unsupervised machine learning algorithm.

Please refer to the Pharo wiki for more information [Pharo wiki](https://github.com/pharo-ai/wiki).

We used some comments from [scikitlearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html#sklearn.cluster.KMeans.transform) in our code.
